hey I'm John canel and today on preppy kitchen we're making a zingy flavorful lemon blueberry cake so let's get started first off set your OV to 350 this batter comes together really quickly now in a large bowl we're going to add our dry ingredients starting with 2 cups or 240 G of allpurpose flour if you don't have a scale make sure you're fluffing your flour and sprinkling it into your measuring cup if you scoop you'll use too much I also want 1 and 2/3 cups of granulated sugar that's 333 G the sugar sweetens the cake but it also gives it a really really tender melt in your mouth consistency for contrast I'm adding 1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt and to Puff things up 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder one and a half by the way if you like delicious things make sure you subscribe to the channel there's two new recipes every single week lots of shorts and always something tasty along the way my scale is done I'm going to grab a whisk I already have a copy of preppy kitchen super easy grab one Link in the description box below if you don't we're going to give this a whisk and get everything nicely distributed Reserve 1 tbspoon of your dry mixture and set this aside now it's time to grab a big bowl in a hand mixer or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment into the bowl of my stand mixer I'm adding 3/4 of a cup or 170 G of very nice softened butter it's room temperature but room temperature on a warm day can see my finger goes right in the butter bends nicely this means it's in a cream perfectly that's one and 1/2 sticks when I just started writing recipes for the blog I would just say one and a half sticks of butter or two sticks of butter not realizing that the sticks of butter are different sizes in different countries now we have cups and grams so we're always going to be sure I'm going to cream this up on medi for just a few seconds  that looks really nice and now we're going to do something special I'm adding the dry ingredients including the sugar right into the butter and we're going to mix this up on medi low until it's nice and crbly so this is called the reverse creaming method and it is so nice because it makes your cake basically foolproof we're coating all the flour in fat from the butter and that protects it from activating and becoming gmy and gluey and overmixed basically the gluten in the flour won't activate when it hits the wet stuff and you don't have to worry about over mixing your cake it's very nice gives you a really really tender melt in your mouth crb I'm scraping my paddle down as well as the bowl just to make sure that there's no solid butter hanging around I want everything nicely mixed you're going to end up with something like a wet Sandy mixture for regular cake batter you'd be creaming the butter adding the sugar fluffing it up then adding the flour alternating with the wet and dry ingredients this is just just simpler and you can't get it wrong just make sure that there's no big chunks of butter hanging out and then we're on to the next step  I increased speed to medi for a few seconds and when you take a look into the bowl you can see it's beautiful crbly they're all small pieces it's like beautiful sand from the most perfect beach ever now in a medi Bowl I'm going to combine all the wet ingredients starting with a/2 cup or 120 MLS of sour cream this gives you so much flavor and it kind of grounds the cake it gives it some substance without making it dense and you have a little bit of a Tang to contrast with the sweetness we're also adding in half a cup of whole milk and if you're wondering where the lemon flavor comes from it really comes from the lemon zest we're going to add you want about a tablespoon which is two lemons worth I'm using a microplane or rasp just to get the yellow part off of the skin that's where the oil is the pith is kind of bitter and does not have that London flavor we love tap that in cut your lemon and we want 3 tspoons of juice you don't need that much because we already have a lot of liquid in this recipe measure Out 3 tablespoons save the rest of your lemon juice for your frosting and for some structure I'm adding three egg whites if you're wondering why we're not using the yolks it's really for the color I want to have this kind of cold White color for the cake so the yolks can't go in  one if a little yolk goes in don't worry about it that's totally fine I'm going to add in a tablespoon of vanilla now we're going to whisk this up till it's nice and smooth right now you're just breaking up the egg whites and the sour cream the rest mixes very well before everything comes together we have one more thing to do and that's combine our tablespoon of reserved dry mixture with our blueberries just give that little toss the flower in theory traps a little bit of air around the blueberries and helps them to float in your batter and not just sink to the bottom with my mixer running on low I'm going to drizzle in this wet mixture once everything's nice and combined get rid of that paddle I like to keep a special eye out for any zest that's clinging here because the zest has so much flavor in it now I'm going to dp my blueberries in and fold them in gently just fold those in be gentle with your berries give the bowl a scrape just to make sure that nothing's lingering at the bottom and this is ready to go into our pans right now I'm going to grab three 6in pans although you could make this into 8 in pans it's totally up to you butter and flour them so just prep the edge and add a parchment round this is your insurance policy that nothing will stick in the pan if you're never worried about that sort of thing you can just butter and flour the pans distribute the batter evenly into your pans what I'm trying to do is distribute the blueberries evenly into the pans if you want you can eyeball it but I like to use a scale just to make sure everything is exactly the same an equal amount of batter in each pan means that the cakes will bake up together evenly if one has a lot less batter it'll be done first and overbake if you take them all at the same time this is optional but I'm using baking strips today these are just wet fabric strips that you wrap around your pans and it insulates them so they bake up really flat there's no doming and the edge of the pan has a cake that's nice and soft if you prefer to have a cake that is kind of like crisp and caramelized on the outside just don't do this using cake strips also means that you won't have any snacking cake when you trim the tops off my Cake's ready to go into the oven 350 for about 30 minutes or until the center is springy to the touch and you go while my cakes are baking we're going to do two things grab a half a cup of blueberries pop these onto a small plate spread them out and these can go right into your freezer this is for the decoration and when they come out they're going to have that lovely covered in Frost look which looks really pretty if you don't want to do this skip that step now in a small saucepan I'm adding one cup of fresh blueberries a tablespoon of water a tablespoon of lemon juice the lemon is so zingy it really pairs nicely with the blueberries and wakes the flavor up and I will say if you've ever had like a sad batch of blueberries they looked perfect you eat them and they have almost no taste the lemon will fix all of that and save the day and if they're flavorful blueberries it'll be even better and I also want one tblspoon of sugar we don't need that much to sweeten this up [Music] grab a spoon and we're going to place this over medi low heat and cook it down this is such a nice burst of flavor for the cake I really hope you make this step if you need to skip it cuz you're super short on time you could use an equal amount of blueberry jam overheat you go while this is over medi low heat I'm going to give it a stir and also do a little smashing so start bursting those blueberries so they cook down faster and actually if your blueberries are strong like mine a spoon is not going to be as good as a fork so grab a big fork and get to mashing after about a minute or so over medi low heat I've mashed all the blueberries it's all mixed up and this has come to a boil so now we're going to reduce this to a sier and let this sier away until it's reduced by half and gets a slightly Jay consistency this step totally depends on your cooktop my stove has a cook top that is hot as a dragon's mouth and everything happens very quick on it an electric stove a gas might be more gentle propane runs pretty hot too so know your cooktop and just watch until this is reduced by half and is slightly thickened ooh all so quickly by the way so quickly it gets the most beautiful natural color I love this cake after about 5 minutes for Me Maybe six or 7 minutes for you my blueberry reduction has reduced it looks so Jay and lovely this is going to add so much to the cake but I do want to run it through a strainer so there's no big pieces of blueberry skin hanging out pop that in [Music] there all right run it through all we want is that delicious blueberry reduction not the [Music] Skins scrape the bottom of your Sie so it gets all of that juice off and set this de side to cool my cakes are cooling and they look so puffy and beautiful I can't wait to pop these out but first you have to make the buttercream so grab 1 and 1/2 cups or 340 G of softened unsalted butter this is room temperature but think about it as room temperature on a warm day just like with the cake I can press in very easily and it's in a cream up beautifully cream it up for just a few seconds I want about 3 tbspoon of lemon juice so now would be a good time to squeeze a lemon once your Butter's creamed we're going to add six cups of powdered sugar add your sugar in a few batches maybe two cups at a time mix on low and drizzle some lemon juice in as you go for contrast I'm also adding in a/4 teaspoon of kosher salt here we go just a little bit and the last batch of powdered sugar because this is American buttercream you can really do the powdered sugar to taste if you want to stop at 5 cups that's totally fine if you wanted to add a little bit more you could do that too the only thing that'll change besides the taste is the consistency of the buttercream the sugar helps give it some structure so with less sugar it'll be a bit more slack and you might have some drooping in your layer cake matting in the remaining tablespoon of lemon juice and it's a good time to scrape the bowl down I'm going to mix this on high for just 1 minute to really things up and make sure it's all mixed well then we're going to divide our mixture and flavor some of it with blueberries just a little mixing later and my buttercream is like blindingly white compared to what it was before it's basically glowing in the medi Bowl I'm going to transfer about 3/4 of a cup of my buttercream and flavor it with my blueberry reduction we didn't forget about that and it's going to give us so much flavor and beautiful color I'm going to add my blueberry reduction to my reserved buttercream about a tablespoon at a time and mix it in until I have the desired color flavor and consistency it's totally up to you and if you have any left over you can drizzle that between the layers or you can make the whole batch of buttercream lemon blueberry flavored it's really up to you and how you want to decorate the cake at this point look at this color that is stunning oh my gosh The Taste is excellent too M it's so nice it's time to assemble our cake I let my cakes cool in the pan which was fine because I had that parchment paper so pretty  snip the tips off your piping bags if you're using them I'm going to do blueberry buttercream in the middle and lemon buttercream on the [Music] outside the second layer is the same as the first blueberry buttercream in the middle and lemon buttercream on the outside pop that last layer on top you could completely coat this in buttercream the recipe makes enough buttercream for this 6-in cake totally coated and decorated with dollops and Frills or an 8in two layer cake also totally coated I'm going to do this with a nice coating on top some dollops and then I'm going to leave it almost naked on the sides so all these beautiful blueberries come through it's one of my favorite parts of the cake I have my remaining buttercream in this Piping Bag I gave it a really quick whip on high just to restore it because buttercream will settle and and become kind of foamy if you leave it for a few minutes so I want this to be silky smooth which means it needed a quick whip I'm adding some to the top and some to the sides but I'm not going to go crazy I popped my cake onto a turntable if you don't have one you can grab the turntable from your microwave and apparently that works too or just do it on the countertop smooth the top and smooth the side as well I'm actually going to do like basically a crb coat on this so all those blueberries shine through if your Cake's crooked you can just straighten it up and pop it into the fridge if it's really bad or just keep going you could also pop a skewer through the middle to hold it in place pull the top in for a nice [Music] Corner finish your cake with a ring of dollops along the top chill your cake so the frosting can set then just before serving top with your frozen blueberries give it a slice and you're ready to [Music] enjoy that cake is packed with blueberry and lemon flavor and it just melt in your mouth amazing I hope you had a chance to make this recipe and if you like this video hit that subscribe button and check out my easy cake playlist [Music]

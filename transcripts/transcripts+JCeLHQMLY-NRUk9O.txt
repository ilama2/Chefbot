 Let's go! Hello everybody! Today my kids are not with me. I'm gonna be cooking by myself without any distractions. Trust me having kids in the kitchen is just insane. Today I'm gonna show you how to make a dish it's called Mandi. Yes Mandi. Based on many of your requests you have asked me to do this dish so I'm gonna show you how to make it today. Usually they make this dish outside they dig a hole underground and they put charcoal and they put a pot of rice on top of it they put the chicken they cover it up and they let it cook but if you don't have an underground oven I'm gonna show you how to make it in your kitchen and the unique thing about this dish is that it tastes all smoky full of flavors. My channel is about introducing Saudi food the easy way. So are you ready to do it the Saudi style? Yalla! In a small plate bring one teaspoon of colored saffron and a little bit of black pepper. I'm gonna add a little bit of salt and a little bit of turmeric powder. Add one teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of Saudi mixed spices. You need a kitchen glove to do this otherwise your hands will get all yellow. Start mixing all the spices together and adding all the spices on the chicken. Start rubbing it all by hand till you get the whole chicken covered with the spice mix on both sides. Now on medium heat add five tablespoons of oil. I usually like to use olive oil since it's more healthy. Now add four pieces of medium-sized chopped onions. Add a little bit of salt and a little bit of black pepper. Add a little bit of black pepper. Add a little bit of garlic. Add a little bit of ginger. Add a little bit of garlic. Add a little bit of garlic. Add a little bit of ginger. Add a little bit of garlic. Now mix it well till the onions become golden brown. Once done remove it from the stove. In a metal pot add the golden brown onions. Add two cinnamon sticks, five pieces cardamom pods, six pieces cloves, one and a half tablespoon salt. Add half a cup of yellow raisins. Add three cups of basmati rice that has been washed and drained. Add two liters of semi-hot water. Mix it well till all the spices are combined together. To test if you have enough water, add a little bit of water to the pot. Add a little bit of water. Put your finger in the pot and the water has to come a little bit less than the middle of your finger. After you have added a little bit of water in the pot, stick your finger in the pot again and check to see if it covers your index finger. Now there are different ways to put the chicken on the rice. You can use any kind of strainer that has holes in it. You can use a steamer strainer or you can use a pizza pan. Or another way to do it is to bring aluminum foil and cover the top of the rice with it. You can make it into one or two layers. I prefer two layers. And then you start bringing anything that is pointy and you start putting holes in the aluminum foil. I prefer to use the metal rack so I put it on top of the rice. And now I bring the chicken, both of them, and place them on top. Now add the pot in a preheated oven at 185 degrees and let it cook for one hour or one hour and 20 minutes maximum. Tick tock, tick tock. The Monday is ready. You want to take the chicken, put it aside. Can you guys see this? Come, I'll show you. Look at this. And look at the chicken. So now what you want to do is take the chicken and put it inside. Okay. Ouch. Careful. It's so hot. Put the chicken inside. And then you bring like a small little aluminum paper, you make it into a small plate. We're going to put oil inside. Any kind of oil. It doesn't matter. And then we're going to put a hot charcoal on top of it. So we're going to put this here inside and we're going to put a little oil in the aluminum foil. Okay, you get the really hot charcoal. Put it inside. See how much smoke it's coming out? Close it right away. See that smoke? and then you want to cover it well so the smoke gets sealed inside. Leave this for around 10 to 15 minutes. The more cloth you put the better it is. You want the smoke to be sealed inside as much as possible. Now we're ready to serve Asadi style. Can you see the smoke? Take the charcoal out. Put water on it before you throw it in the trash can. We're gonna add a little bit of fried onions, a little bit of roasted pine nuts, a little bit of shredded roasted almonds and a little bit of chopped coriander. You guys have to see this. This is our dish for suhoor by the way. My husband's waiting for me so we can eat. Seriously the smell is just all over the place. Wow the smokiness. You guys try it and let me know what you think. Dinner is served. Come say hi to my friends please. My husband doesn't know how to say hi. He doesn't want to come on camera. Fadi I'm just saying your name. He's shy. Aren't you hungry? Come eat.

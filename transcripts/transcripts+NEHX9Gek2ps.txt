Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. This Tuscan chicken will be ready before you know it, so let's get started. First off, we're gonna grate 1/2 a cup of Parmesan cheese, and, yes, you can be a little generous if you want. Okay, this gets set aside. Let's finish the prep. I'm gonna smash and mince four cloves of garlic. Do not use that bottled, pre-minced garlic. It does not taste the same. All right, let's set that garlic aside. And now for the flavor in this dish. The sun-dried tomatoes, they add so much. And even if you don't like raw tomatoes, you will love sun-dried tomatoes. They are packed with flavor, so we do wanna give them a slice so you're not having giant mouthfuls of them. I'm using about 1/2 a cup for this recipe but you could scale that up, if you really want it packed with flavor, or decrease that slightly if you like things on the mild side. Set that aside and then our last prep is the chicken. We're gonna take these breasts and pound them out to be about an inch thick. You don't want this to go into the oven, so we want this to cook really quickly and absorb a ton of flavor. So more surface area for that chicken. Four breasts, this will serve anywhere between four to six people. You can give them a slice before serving or serve them whole. Give those hands a wash. (upbeat music) We're gonna season this chicken liberally with salt and pepper. You wanna see like some sprinkles on the surface. Flip them over and repeat. (upbeat music) Before we dredge the chicken, let's add two tablespoons of butter and a drizzle of olive oil to our pan and set that over medi-high heat. So that'll be nice and hot by the time this is all dredged up. I'm adding about 1/4 cup of flour to a plate for dredging. And now we're just gonna coat our chicken in the flour. This will give it a beautiful, like brown, as well as kind of some texture to absorb all the flavors in that creamy Tuscany chicken. Just gonna set it aside and dredge the rest. (upbeat music) Wash, wash wash. Add your chicken to the pan. And you can cook this in batches. I'll have one extra chicken breast I'm gonna cook after these three. This is gonna get covered while it cooks so that it can really cook through a bit more. I do not want it pink in the middle. I want it cooked all the way through. (upbeat music) This meal is one of my favorites because it cooks up so quickly, there's barely any prep, and the leftovers are delicious. It's good with pasta. You could also have it with vegetables and it's so just filling and comforting. Mm. It's been about four minutes. Let's give it a check. Beautiful golden color. Cover it back up. Keep cooking. Let's take a peek. Okay, that is a beautiful golden color on both sides. And it's also cooked through, so we're gonna remove this onto a plate, cook that remaining piece of chicken and then make the sauce. (pan sizzling) Oh! That was a little oil. It's fine. It's fine. (upbeat music) All right. Last piece of chicken is all done. Gonna remove this to the plate and then turn the heat down to medi-low. We're gonna add two tablespoons of butter onto the pan, and as soon as that's melted, let's get that garlic nice and fragrant. This cooks so fast and you don't wanna burn it. Give it like 30 to 45 seconds over heat and then just grab one tablespoon of flour. We're gonna sprinkle that in and cook that with the butter and the garlic. It'll make a really simple roux and then your sauce is gonna be so thick and luscious and amazing. Now we're gonna mix in 3/4 of a cup of chicken stock. Just drizzle it in slow while you work this pan. (pan sizzling) Let this cook down and reduce about by half, and then we're gonna stir in that cheese and cream. I'm also gonna grab some oregano. One teaspoon right in there. Once it's reduced by half, we're gonna add that Parmesan cheese right into the pan and stir in 1 1/2 cups of cream. If you want, you can totally sub half and half for the cream or go half milk half cream. Right now, I'm gonna add the sun dried tomatoes and then this will just sier for a while until it gets nice and bubbly. Won't be very long. Let that warm up. The cheese will melt. The sauce will start thickening and bubbling, and the flavor from that sun dried tomato will just go, , and be a chef's kiss. Okay, it's bubbling away. (upbeat music) I'm going to add in two cups of spinach. And for those of you who don't know, two cups of spinach is like two handfuls like this. So it cooks down to nothing. So you wanna grab a lot of it. You could even add the whole container in if you like it extra spinachy. This is gonna wilt really quickly. Just get it so it's a nice emerald green, nice and loose. Just like it is over here, and then we can add the chicken in. Okay. That looks perfect. This is cooled down. You want the chicken to warm through while the sauce continues to thicken. So this can sier away in the pan for a few minutes and then it's ready to serve. By the way, right now is a good time to give it a taste. That's nice. It might need a pinch of salt. This doesn't. You might want a little bit more pepper. That's fine. I could add a little pepper to this. There we go. If you like this video, check out my chicken dinner playlist. (upbeat music) Oh my gosh, that is a symphony of flavor, and I love that garlicky spinach. I'll see you in the next video.

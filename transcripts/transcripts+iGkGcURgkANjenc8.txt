These guys are peak ripeness for eating, but not for baking. You want your baking bananas to be almost decomposing, soft, mushy, and brown. Lay these out on a baking sheet and then bake them at 350 for about 10 to 12 minutes. I'm gonna show what that looks like right now. They've totally blackened. They're super soft and like pudding on the inside. If you wanna make banana bread, you do not need those mega ripe bananas. Just bake them up first. For the dry ingredients, I want one and three quarter cups of flour. That's 215 grams if you're using a scale. If you're not using a scale, don't forget to fluff your flour up first. You wanna get it nice and fluffy in the canister and then sprinkle it in. Using a teaspoon of kosher salt. If you're using a really fine grain salt, use half the amount. Because the finer the salt crystal, the more you're adding for every teaspoon, in case you didn't know. For spice, I'm using half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon. You could add any of your favorites to this and it'll be delicious. For leavening, all we need is a teaspoon of baking soda. So let's pop that in there. Give this a quick whisk. And we're gonna set it aside. My bananas have cooled enough to touch. And look at this. It is totally just banana jello on the inside, which is what you want for baking. Plop those bananas in there. They smell so good. I love this baking trick because sometimes when you're making something with bananas, you're waiting. You're like, I'm waiting for those bananas to be perfectly ripe. But then you forget about it. And the next day they've gone too far or someone threw them out, in which case you're so not happy. This way you can just use them right away. There's no waiting. All right, mush these up. You wanna have like a nice paste. And if you baked them for enough time, they're just gonna mush up really, really easily. You can see these are basically like a banana pudding. Setting my bananas aside. And now we're gonna cream the butter and sugar together. Something so pleasing about opening up a new package of brown sugar. I think it's the promise of knowing there's not any giant brown sugar rocks. And if you're watching this in the UK, I'm fairly certain brown sugar is the same as Muscovado sugar. But you can let me know in the comments. Three quarters of a cup of brown sugar packed tightly. That's 150 grams. If you're counting. We're gonna add our half cup of room temperature unsalted butter here and cream this up, then add the brown sugar. Okay, you could do this in the stand mixer if you wanted to. If your butter's the right consistency, it's gonna cream up pretty quickly. If it was like rock hard, you might need to give it like maybe five or 10 seconds in the microwave at half power. Okay, break up your brown sugar a bit because even though I opened a fresh bag, there could always be lumps. There's gonna be lumps hiding in there. Cream it up until it's lighter in color and kind of fluffy. Brown sugar doesn't cream up exactly the same way as white sugar does, but it's so worth it because it has a wonderful taste. Okay, I'm gonna scrape this bowl down and then it's time to add some room temperature eggs. We're gonna crack our eggs in one at a time, mix it up. And along with that egg, I'm adding a teaspoon of a nice vanilla. This is something I wish you could smell right now. It's so good. Let's mix that in. If you see your batter and it maybe starts breaking or you see little granules, that's totally okay. It doesn't have to be silky smooth. You could have a little bit of butter, a little bit of sugar, a little bit of banana here and there. It'll be delicious anyways. Now I'm gonna mix in my mashed bananas. You do not have to have completely mashed bananas. I personally love having big chunks of banana that I bite into. All right, this is so fun to make and I actually love making this with my kids. It's one of their favorite things to eat for a snack. The banana will mix in right away so you don't even have to use that much elbow grease or anything like that. And if you look closely here, you could see all these little chunks of banana. This is gonna be so delicious. Our last step is to add the dry ingredients and we're gonna fold this in by hand. Any cake that you make is gonna be so much more tender and fluffy and melt in your mouth. It's gonna be so good. I'm gonna put it in my mouth if you don't over mix the batter. So just add the flour in, gently fold it in with your spatula. It's gonna be until it's just combined. You could definitely make this in a stand mixer or keep going with your electric hand mixer, but I love doing this by hand just because I really get a sense for where the batter's at and I know it's gonna be just perfectly mixed. Kind of a more intimate relationship with your baked good. I'm greasing a nine by 13 inch loaf pan, just really lightly with butter. This is really not a sticky batter that's gonna get stuck in here, but a little butter never hurts. You could also use parchment paper or even just a bit of baking spray. Gracefully maneuver that batter into your loaf pan. Oh my gosh, the smell of brown sugar, butter and bananas with a little cinnamon. You can't beat it. And we're just gonna level it out a bit. It's what I'm doing. This is going into the oven, 350 for 50 to 60 minutes. You want a skewer to come out cleanly from the center and probably springy to the touch. Shouldn't be crackling too much either. In you go. I think someone wants a treat. I wanna try some of these banana butter peas. You may. Oh my gosh, how does it smell? Good. Is it very delicious? Oh.

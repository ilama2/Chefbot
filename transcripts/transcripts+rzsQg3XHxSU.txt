- [John] Hey, I'm John Canal and today on Preppy Kitchen, I have a very special video. I'm making a delicious cranberry apple butter bread from my new book with Rie in my mom's kitchen. I'm on my book tour and Rie, can you tell us a little bit about yourself in case they don't know how amazing you are? - Hi, I'm Rie. I make videos for Tasty and Buzzfeed and I also have my own YouTube channel. - Check her out. She's amazing and I love her. (Rie laughs) We're making a delicious bread. - Yes. - The first thing we need, of course, is some happy yeast. - Yes! - So we have three quarters of a cup of warm milk right here. I'm gonna add the yeast in and I'm gonna get this recipe started, but then Rie is gonna help me out and I'm gonna put her to work. (Rie laughs) Add the yeast in there along with one teaspoon of sugar. This is so weird to be my mom's kitchen. - This is your mom's sugar pot. It's so cute. - Add that in there, give it a little stir and we're gonna set it aside for about five minutes until it's nice and foamy. If your yeast doesn't foam up, you have to start over again because they're doing all of the work for this delicious bread. - Yes. - In the bowl of our mixer, we're gonna add two and three quarter cups of all-purpose flour. That's 330 grams. - And this must be flour. - It is flour for sure. Ooh! So my mom said she had cloves, but she has whole cloves. And these are cloves, but because it's like her personal spices, she adds cardamom to them. - Oh, I love cardamom. - So this is a special cloven and cardamon version of the bread. You can always play with the spices in any recipe. - Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. Am I adding to? - We're so close. It's 330. That's good. Perfect. Okay, now we're gonna add three tablespoons of sugar. - Okay. Three table spoons of sugar. Do you have any story about this bread? - I love braided breads and my mother actually is like the bread queen. She loves bringing breads to family dinners. - Aw. - And my dad's side of the family was part Greek, so we had like braided Greek breads too. And in the book I wanted to have like a celebration of fall. So I took apple butter, I took marzipan and we have a fresh cranberry compote we're gonna make. And these things are all gonna work with the cloves and the cardamom today and give you like a perfect bread to have in the morning with a cup of tea or coffee. - Oh ye. That sounds amazing. - And the braiding is really fun too. - Okay. (Rie laughs) - One teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of cloves, clove mixture. - All right. - Just a little bit goes a long way and I love cloves. It's very like fall winter to me. - Ye. Is this your favorite spice? - Cardamom's actually my favorite spice. So I was so happy that my mom added cardamom to hers. It runs in the family. - Ye. - I'm gonna let you do the honors and assemble this all together. So first off, give us a whisk por favor. - All right. Easy peasy. - She loves cardamon too. We had a second where we were heating the butter up and she was telling me all about some delicious cardamom things. I feel like you're my soulmates. - I love cardamom. I think cardamom is one of my favorite spice. - So good, add it to your spice drawer. One egg. This should be room temperature, but if it's cold it's . You could add it to the warm butter and it'll warm everything up. The butter is warm and not hot. Get that a little bit of a mix. - Okay. - It's nice. - How did I do? - You did amazing. Are yeast are nice and happy. So I know it's safe to add them into my flour mixture. - Get in. - All of it. I never like to waste any yeast too 'cause they have so much work to do. - Yes. - We'll add the butter and egg in as well. - Okay. - Ooh, beautiful color. And now here's the deal. Whenever I'd have a dough, even if you read a recipe, like put it in the dough, put it in the mixer, or start on low. I always like to mix it by hand first. - Oh, that's a good tip. - Because especially for enriched doughs where you're adding a lot of butter and eggs and things like that, just make it into a paste to get started. And that way your mixer is doing a lot of work efficiently. - Ye and your flour doesn't fly away. - Exactly. Nobody likes the flour or sugar explosion. This looks great. I'm gonna pop this onto my mom's mixer from the 1980s. - Vintage. - Vintage and it works beautifully. She wants a new one and I'm like, "No, you can never." It works. I'm gonna make her mail it to me if she does get a new one. Okay. We're gonna mix this on medi low for about four minutes until it's tacky, but not sticky. - Tacky not sticky. - So tacky does mean sticky, but it's gonna be tacky and a little bit sticky, but it won't stick to your fingers if it's sticking to your fingers, add about a tablespoon of flour and while it's mixing until it doesn't stick to your fingers. - What is another baking tool people should buy? - Beside a scale. - Ye. - Or a silicon mat. These are greats. Do you use these? - I don't, but maybe I should buy. - I highly recoend you use one of these. They give you cookies that I feel are a little bit less burnt on the bottom. It's almost like an insulator. So that's my thought. - Ye, maybe like, I should buy this. Like whenever I bake macron I feel like it, the bottom, it's too crispy. So maybe I should use. - Use, but for macron paper's actually better. - Really? - Yes. - Okay. Why? - Because the, it's too slippery and they spread too much. - Good tip. Okay. - I messed up so many macarons. I have a lot of tips for you. - Macarons is so difficult to make. - It's sticking to my finger a little bit. I'm gonna add a tables spin of flour in just while it mixes. - There you go. - Thank you. - I'm you're sous chef. - Oh, so we have a swap out for the dough because I don't wanna keep Rie, she has a two and a half year old at home. But my mom helped me make the swap out and it was so fun making something with my mom. It's always fun to have someone in the kitchen with you. - She should bring her, you should make a video with her. Are you already planning one? - I would love that. - Ye. - Love. She's busy with them. She's busy with the grandkids right now. This is almost there. So we'll have this mix for a minute. - Tacky not sticky. - Okay dokey. So I have a little drop of oil in this bowl and I will spread it out. Our dough needs to rise for how long? I forgot. - Isn't it so good to have your book? - It is. Oh my gosh, I've been referring back to my book. It's lovely. I highly recoend everyone get a copy if you haven't already. And I have to tell you, it's been one of like the nicest things in my entire life. Meeting people in person. So, so many lovely people have come out to say hello and it's been nothing but like beautiful stories and a wonderful time. This dough isn't a rise for an hour. That's what I checked my book and it said. - Right. Do you want me to hold it? - Oh thank you. - It's very, very rich. So it's like a nice soft luscious dough. - You've got this. - You can give it a turn or two and just let it get nice and coated with the oil so it doesn't dry out. This will double in size. It could be an hour on the counter or top, or it could be a day in the fridge. So a lot of times like we're busy at home, I don't have time to do a recipe all the way through but I still wanna make something delicious. So for breads, you can leave them in the fridge for a day. Even two days sometimes. Oh, two days is running a risk. But I've ran the risk and it worked. So I'm only advising one day. Cover this up a nice warm, cozy place. But my mom and I made this dough last night so I have a swap out. - Yay shout our mom. - She's a life saver. So I asked my mom if we have a pastry mat at home. This is actually for us to bake on. And she said Yes, we have my grandmother's pastry mat. - Oh yes. - So this is actually a little bit older than I am and I think it still works just fine. So I love that I'm in, I love it being in this kitchen even though it's not. - Look, it has a, how do you call this? - Little suction cups, ye. 'Cause it was like before the silicon mats were popular. - Oh this is awesome. And you can wash it. - You can wash it and use, add a little bit of flour so it doesn't stick. Ah so nice. Watch everything stick horribly to this. One thing that's nice about using the fridge for your dough is it's a little bit firmer so it's still rose up, but it's so much nicer to roll it out. Do you think my mom knows where her rolling pin is? I forgot to ask for one. - Mom. - Mom, can I have a rolling pin please? Thanks Mom. - [Mom] I would not crush so much. - I would've taken a wine glass if you didn't have one. A wine bottle. - [Mom] No, I have more, but I want to sit in my rolling paints one day. - Ooh, I love that. This actually we're jping the gun a little bit 'cause I should make the fillings. At home you're not gonna have a swap out. So we're not gonna roll this up just yet. I'm gonna fold it and set this aside. While your dough rises, we're gonna make two fillings for it. Technically it's three, but I'm assing most people are just gonna buy apple butter. There is a recipe for in the book if you want. - Page? - I don't remember. We have the apple butter, we have a marzipan or frangipane style filling, which is really easy where it's gonna stir together. And we have a cranberry compote. So for the cranberry compote, in a small sauce pan, half a cup of cranberries. These were frozen but they're thawed now. So I have some delicious cranberry juice in there too. I want a quarter cup or four tablespoons of granulated sugar. - Ye, it's a good things to remember. Quarter cup is four tablespoons. - One teaspoon of ginger. And we're gonna pop this over medi heat along with the tablespoon of water. And you basically want this to have two things happening. The cranberries are gonna burst and you can use a spoon to mash them a bit, but it's also gonna congeal into like a beautiful jam. And if you don't wanna do this but you still wanna make this bread, you could use a cranberry sauce instead. - Do you still wanna add spice? - Yes. - Okay. - And you could add other spices too if you wanted to. - Cardamon? - Yes. I was gonna suggest any spice you might like cardamon for example. Okay onto median heat. Come on over. You can have the honors of stirring. - Thank you. I've always wanting to do this. - She's like my dreams have come true. And I'm gonna add the tablespoon of water that I totally forgot about. - Good thing you have your book handy. - These cranberries are going to burst and then we can set everything aside and make our easy frangipane. Do you have a favorite recipe to make for fall? - I like making apple pies. You know like in LA it doesn't get too cool too soon. So like I'm waiting, when can I start making pie? 'Cause you cannot make pies in hot kitchen 'cause butter melts and like you don't want to turn on the oven. - I know it's a whole vibe but I totally get it. it's like you don't feel like doing it until the weather's calmed down and then you can have everything bubbling away in the stove. They have those cozy moments. - I have a question for you. - Yes. - How many plaid shirts do you have? - Well on this trip I brought six. But in my closet, I don't know. I think I have like this many if you like put them close on hangers. I haven't counted. It's a lot. - You should do the tour. - A closet tour. Yes. It'll be a very repetitive video. It would be like the same thing over and over again. It's like, ooh, I'm wearing a cranberry gingham shirt today. - 'Cause like I was watching your video and went to your, you know, front page and you are wearing similar plaid shirt. - This is true. - But it's slightly different. - They're slightly different. So sometimes I'm like, this is a brand. Like I was like wearing a brand new shirt I got from my birthday and I was like, "can you tell?" This is getting really nice and bubbly now I think you can give it a little bit of a pressure. Just to smash them down. That'll get all those juices out. Some of the pectin and it'll help thicken things up. - It's very soft now. - This looks great. I'm gonna take it off heat. - All right. - And the pan has a little bit of residual heat. It'll keep evaporating some of the water and this is gonna be really nice. It can cool. In the meantime we're gonna make our easy frangipane. - Yes. - Yes. I love almonds too. - Oh ye. - I have two tablespoons of softened butter. I was like softening it with my hands. But if you use European style butter because it's all butter fat and there's no water, it's actually not as hard. Another a nice thing. - And hands are best tools. - Yes. One egg. - Okay. - It should be room temperature, but if it's not it's . I want a tablespoon. Oh, sugar. A friend told me that there are four tablespoons of sugar at a quarter cup. - Yes. - We have just enough I have this dainty little sugar thing. I think. - That's exactly four tablespoons. - Perfect. - Yay. - And also one quarter of a teaspoon of almond extract. You can eyeball it. I'm using my mom's mixer. Just very powerful, oh my gosh. So you're gonna mix this up until it's nice and smooth. I don't wanna see any lps of butter in here, but honestly you can have a couple lps. Mix this up for one minute or until it is nice and fluffy. Does that look fluffy? - I think we need a little more. - Okay. - Oh this was not the highest speed. - That was low. What brand is this? Okay, that's good 'cause I feel like it's about to take-off into outer space. - Yes. - One cup of almond flour. - Okay. - And then to help firm things up a little bit too, one tablespoon of flour. We're gonna mix this on low until just combined. Okay, it'll be nice and thick and form a paste. Perfect. Now for the first time we can roll our dough out. - Yay. - Rie? - Yes. - Do you think you could roll this out into a 16 by 11 inch rectangle? - Yes. Because we have measured here. - Thank you Grandma. - What did you say? 16 by? - 16 by 11. - 11. Okay. - I love seeing all the little bits of clove in the dough and it's gonna be a very nice almost subtle flavor even though clove is so strong. The chia babka in the book also from the fall chapter has a lot of black tea leaves that are infused into the milk. It has speckles of black all throughout. And I love the way it looks when it's rolling, getting rolled out. - Which one was the most difficult recipe? Like to test? - To test? The chocolate carrot cake took so long because I had a dream of you know you have a recipe in your mind. - Ye. - And you're like, in my mind it's gonna be like this. You're like trying and trying and trying to get to be like that. So I wanted the cake to be as chocolatey and like I wanted like chocolate in my mouth and a lot of spices too. So it just took a long time to get, I had to keep adding more chocolate and different kinds. And then the nicest part of that though was the frosting is a cream cheese frosting with orange and orange and cream cheese go so well together. - How do they look? 16 by 11. - Well let's see. - Okay. - I'm give it a little bit of, I think this is like 11 inches right now. But like, But I think we need a bit more. A bit more length. - Also this marble rolling pin is so nice. - It's doing a lot of work. - Ye. So it's easier to roll everything thin. - It's time to spread. The frangipane or the almond paste as to go right down the middle. So like a strip of three inches but leave an inch on either side. I love like this mark on this. - Got it. - Initial I said clean. - All right so we gonna do, we gonna use all? - All all of it. - Okay. - Thank you so much for coming out by the way. - Of course. Any time. It's fun. - Rie and I got to do something like a year ago I think. I made, I made something fancy for her. One of her like popular, she has many popular things, but one of her popular video series is called Make It Fancy where she takes something and she like does some magic on it. So I took a store bought cake and I made it fancy. - Yes, it was so fancy. - Oh, thank you. - Ye. And this is our first time meeting on person. - But I feel like we're friends already. - Yes, I feel like I know you forever. - I want three tablespoons of apple butter and you could totally buy this or you can make it on your own. It's fun to make apple butter because it smells so good. It like makes your whole kitchen smell like an apple pie for hours. - Ye and it's kind of fun to see all the apples disappear. - Ye and change color too. Ye because it like really gets caramelized down. You could spread that out too. - Oh smells good. I hope someone invent technology that you can smell through the screen. - Oh my gosh. It would be amazing. - Right? Isn't it? - It would also be very truth telling. Like if something isn't delicious and someone's claiming it, the viewers would know for sure. - Yes. - Here we have our cranberries and look how, see how firmed it's set up. - Wow, it's like a quick jam. - It really is a quick jam. The cranberries did their business and I'm gonna spread this out a little bit and you can spread it more and it does not have to be to be perfectly even. The ginger and the cloves are coming together with the apples to give you all the fall flavors. So now we're going to do our cuts. I'll do half the cuts and you can do the other half. - All right. You should show me 'cause I have no idea what is going on. - Ye, this is like something that you really try to explain in writing but seeing it is always so much easier. I'm being gentle with my grandmother's pastry mat. But we're gonna take two notches out of each side so the corners, were eliminating it. And now we want to have one inch little fringes on either side. So one and it could be a little bit thicker or thinner. Just try and get them to be kind of the same size. And last time I did this I used a measuring tape and marked it all. But today I'm feeling adventurous and I'm just eyeballing it. Those are mine. I'm fairly happy. So now you can do the other ones. - Okay. Following your your line, right? - Ye, it doesn't have to be like, it could be a little bit off. I can mark it for you if that helps. - Ye. - The last thing we're gonna do is take this notch off, like this. So now,  this is the fun part. You fold over to make like a little burrito almost. - Like this? - Yep. - Okay. - And now we're going to just start crossing it over. And I'm so bad I have like actually concentrate 'cause I would just lose the pattern even though it was so simple. - I think it's cute. - And we'll finish off by folding it all under like that. Just like this. One thing I forgot that's somewhat important. This has happened to me so many times and I'll share 'cause we're being vulnerable, you have to get this over here but I have a trick. I only have a trick because I've been very forgetful many times. We can't bake the fabric but what we can do is roll it out. There we go. Confidence. And we're gonna loosely cover this and let it rise for about 15 minutes. It just needs to puff up a bit. And in the meantime we're gonna have a nice conversation. - Yes. - Wait, I'm trying the braided thing but Rie is like much better than I am. I have to like also keep going 'cause if I stop, I lose my pattern and it doesn't turn out. - You did it. - Rie was like, "I don't know how to braid." (Rie laughs) - You did it. - Okay. There we go. - Beautiful. - Oh thank you. It's been about 15 minutes. We had a charming conversation. - Yes. - Our bread has risen up and we have our two little braids that we made too. And they're super puffy now. - Oh it's so soft. I should not have lifted it up. - It was like wait till it bakes. So we're gonna have an egg wash for this. You can do the honors. - All right. - One egg. We're just gonna mix it up and then whenever you add an egg wash it just adds shine and creates a beautiful golden color. So it's always a must for breads that I make. Okay, so let's brush that over gently. - Okay. - So at home I actually have like some nice painting brushes. That I got at the art store. And I only use them for pastry stuff because like see that how dented did in right now. All the pastry brushes you get at the store for food are like pretty rough. So I like to have a gentle sable brush. - What is your husband's favorite food from your book? - Oh from the book? I think he really likes the apple butter cake. So there's a cake and it has tons of apples in it has a little bit of thyme just for an herbal note. And it's a two layer cake in between apple butter. So it has a brown butter maple vanilla frosting. And it is like all the fall flavors you could want. I think his actual favorite cake though is the chocolate carrot cake 'cause he loves the cream cheese's frosting on it so much. - The one you said it's most difficult one to develop. - Yes, it was the most work for me. - This is ready to go into the oven 350 for about half an hour or until it's golden brown, puffed and it smells amazing. In you go. Our bread's baking. It smells really good, if I don't say so myself. It's gonna be finished off with a really easy glaze and you could add any of your favorite flavors to you want. Think of this as a blanket canvas. So half a cup of powdered sugar into a small bowl. - Okay, first powder sugar. - Two to three teaspoons of milk. I want this to be nice and just a good drizzling consistency - Ye. - That's perfect. So it'll drizzle on over and be a nice sweet start for each bite. - What kind of flavoring do you suggest or recoend? - Because we're talking about orange, I would love to have like a little bit of orange zest in here. - That's first thing I thought. - Orange juice. Or you could also have some spices in here too. - Ye, why not? - Just like a little pinch of my mom's cardamon clove combination. And then that'll add a nice aroma. After baking I let the bread cool for about 20 minutes and now we can top it with our easy breezy glaze. - Ye. - You want me to do it? - You should do it. - Just drizzle it over. It's really just like a carefree, little bit of extra sweetness. - Nice. - There we go. - It's a very nice consistency. - It's sliced up nice. - Ye, it's just like in your book. - Thank you. Okay, we're gonna take a bite. Tell me what you think. - Okay. M. Oh my god, it's so good. - Not too sweet. - The best compliment from Asian person. - I hope you get a chance to make this recipe.

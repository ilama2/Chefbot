Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. This French toast will be ready before you know it. So let's get started. We're gonna measure out 3 1⁄4 of a cup of whole milk. If you want this to be extra rich, you could use some half and half or even add some cream in there. Into a big bowl, I'm adding 3 1⁄4 of a cup of milk. Into that milk, we're gonna crack four eggs, a 1⁄4 cup of sugar to keep it sweet. And now, for some flavor, we're gonna add 1⁄2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and of course, a generous splash of vanilla, two teaspoons, maybe a little bit extra. Give this a good whisk. This smell, by the way, already is magic. Okay, our custard is all ready to go. Now we're gonna need a big pan, maybe a dot of butter, and our bread. We're gonna place this over medium, medium-high heat. Today I'm using a thick sliced white bread. You can use any of your favorite breads for French toast. Brioche is a favorite if you wanna go rich, and if you wanna be super decadent, you can slice croissants in half and make croissant French toast too. You want your bread to soak up some of this delicious custard, but not be so waterlogged that it falls apart. So plop it into there. Just press it down a little bit. After a few seconds, flip it over. Plop some butter on that pan. Get it nice and melty. Okay. Now we can place our soaked bread on there. And then as you go, you're gonna dip more bread and just keep going. After a minute or so, flip it over. It'll be nice and golden. As soon as it's golden, we're gonna add our flour. We're gonna add a little bit of flour to that. It's gonna be a little bit more than we need. Okay. Golden brown on both sides, place it onto a platter or right onto the plate if you're eating it super fast. Little bit more butter and just keep going. Forgot to soak my bread. French toast is the perfect recipe for when you wanna put something on people's plate in the morning and have it be like fancy and delicious with zero effort. You're literally just making a really quick custard with eggs and milk, flavoring it, and then heating it up on a pan. It's so fast and basically foolproof. Everyone's gonna love you and this was my mother's trick growing up. She would make French toast all the time. My brother and I loved it, but the secret is it's so easy. Serve with maple syrup, fruit, whatever you'd like and you're gonna be in heaven. If you like this video, check out my breakfast playlist. I'll see you in the next video. Bye.

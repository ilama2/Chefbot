Hey everyone, get ready to bake cream puffs so incredible they'll make you a legend in your own kitchen! First things first: crack two eggs into a bowl. Try not to get any shell in there—extra crunch isn't part of the recipe. Stir in the eggs and let them patiently wait for their moment in the spotlight. Then, sift in some flour. Cake flour is ideal, but all-purpose flour will do the job too. We're not snobs here. In a pan, add some water, butter (the real stuff, not the fake margarine nonsense), and a pinch of salt. Melt the butter in the water until they're fused together like best friends at a party. Once it starts boiling, remove it from the heat and iediately stir in the flour. Mix until the mixture is fully combined. Put the pan back on the stove. Cook on medi heat until the dough thickens. You'll know it's ready when it looks like Play-Doh. Transfer the dough to a bowl and spread it out. This helps it cool down a bit. Gradually pour the eggs into the batter like you're adding a touch of magic. Stir until the mixture transforms into a smooth, glossy dough that looks like it could star in its own cooking show. Load the dough into a pastry bag. If you don't have one, a bag with the corner snipped off works in a pinch. Pipe small circles, about 2-3 cm wide, onto a baking sheet. These little guys are going to puff up, so give them some space. While our puffs are in the sauna, let's whip up some heavenly cream. First, separate the egg yolks from the whites. You can keep the whites for making an omelette or experimenting with meringue later. Then mix the yolks with sugar because even yolks need a little sweetness in their lives. Add some flour and mix until it's smooth. We're aiming for velvety perfection here. Pour in warm milk, stirring constantly. It's starting to smell pretty fantastic, right? Cook this mixture in a saucepan over medi heat until it thickens into a luscious custard. Don't walk away—it'll happen fast. Transfer the custard cream to a plate, cover it with cling film, and let it cool to room temperature. Then pop it in the refrigerator to chill. Now let's make the whipped cream. Measure out 150 ml of heavy cream and pour it into a bowl. Add some sugar. Whisk heavy cream with sugar until it forms peaks. Think snowy mountain tops. Combine the custard and whipped cream. This is where the magic happens. Our filling is born! Mix well. Feel free to use a mixer. Voila! The cream's ready. Try not to eat it all before it makes it to the puffs. Time to fetch those puffs from the oven. Prepare for a glorious sight. Fantastic! They've puffed up beautifully with a crisp shell and a perfectly hollow center. Fill a pastry bag with the cream—though I have to admit, resisting the urge to eat it straight from the bowl is a real challenge! Fill them with the cream using a pastry bag. Go ead, be generous. Nobody likes a stingy cream puff. Enjoy the contrast of the crunchy, slightly salty puff with the sweet, soft cream. It’s a match made in dessert heaven. Bon appétit!

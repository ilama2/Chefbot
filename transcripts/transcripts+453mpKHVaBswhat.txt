Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These churros will be ready before you know it, so let's get started. These come together so quickly. So pour some oil into a big pot. Set up your candy thermometer. You don't wanna guess the weight. No, wait. You don't wanna guess the temperature, you wanna know the temperature so your churros are perfectly golden. We're gonna turn that on soon, but for now, let's get these dry ingredients together. I'm gonna weigh out one cup of flour, it's 120 grams. Set that aside. And now we're gonna combine almost all the ingredients, except for the flour, in your pot. I'm gonna cut up tablespoon sized pieces of butter just so they melt quicker. And I'm using six tablespoons, or 85 grams. That butter doesn't have to be room temperature, but it'll boil much quicker if it is. So 1/4 cup of sugar, right in you go. That's 50 grams. You'`re gonna add a cup of water, one cup exactly. Last into the pot is 1/2 teaspoon of salt. It's gonna give us a nice contrast. We're gonna place this over medi heat and bring it to a rolling boil. If this sounds familiar, it's because we're making choux. If you know what choux is, you know. Okay. Let's grab a wooden spoon and your just gonna stir this a little bit as it comes to a boil. It'll start boiling fairly quickly, so be ready. So this came to a rolling boil, turn it off heat, dp the flour in, and stir it up. You're gonna see it come together fairly quickly. It'll come into a ball, and then we're gonna place this overheat one more time to cook the flour and really bring it together. Now let's put it over heat. Stir, stir, stir, stir, stir. You're gonna see this come together. It's gonna pull away from the pan and then you know it is already. So easy. Thirty seconds is all you need. We're gonna set this aside for a minute. Get our standard mixer out and some eggs too. Don't forget the eggs. Right now, we're gonna dp this hot dough into our stand mixer. I have a paddle attachment on this. You can let it hang out here for a second if you don't want to burn the eggs. It's never happened to me, but it's the best practice. I'm gonna crack three eggs. But as you know, if you've ever made choux, you don't know how many eggs you need until you look at the batter, so have one more at the ready. Nobody wants shells in their churros so go ead and you know, use a separate bowl. Best practice. Don't crack them right in there. Get this mixer started. Get this mixer plugged in and started. (mixer whirring) Oh, you see the steam coming out? It needs to cool down for a hot second. I also have vanilla ready. It's gonna go in and just make this taste even that more delicious. All right, add the eggs in one at a time. You're gonna see the dough really comes together, becomes luscious and just beautifully cohesive. You're mixing on a medi speed. Now here's the test. Lift this up. And the dough should be gracefully falling off the paddle, not really like cling to it. It needs to look beautiful and silky. And right now it's looking silky, but not so beautiful. You want it to be gently and gracefully falling off, not plopping off like that. I'm gonna crack one more egg into a bowl. This is my last egg. I'm gonna give it a little bit of a mix. We're gonna add this in as needed. I might add half the egg in or the whole thing. We'll see. (mixer whirring) I also want to scrape the bowl down. In addition to that half egg, I'm adding one teaspoon of a nice vanilla, right in there. Okay, let's mix it up. I'm gonna scrape the bowl down one last time. Oh yes. You know what it looks like? It looks like a wonderful thick custard. So take a look at this. This is totally different. Do you see that? It's just a beautiful, like glossy silky batter. It's falling gently from the beater. Ye, just like that. Now we get to fry this up. It's so easy. (phone ringing) - [John's Mom] Hi John. - Hi mom. I love you. - [John's Mom] I love you. - All right, so- - [John's Mom] I was in the garden. - I'm filming a YouTube. So when you say churros, do you say churros or what do you say? - [John's Mom] Churros. - Churros. Okay. Just double checking. All right. Wave bye-bye. - Bye. I love you. - Love you too. Bye. I have a big piping bag out. My favorite open star tip, it's an 869. You could use any big star tip if you want though. Snip the tip off. And fill this up with our delicious churro choux. Normally I would tell you not to overfill your piping bag, but this time just fill it right up because you don't want to stop and start. Oh my gosh. This batter smells so good. I really wish you could smell it right now. Okay. This is ready to go. In the meantime, I'm going to make some cinnamon sugar and also get my oil nice and hot. While that's heating up, we're gonna make our cinnamon sugar. One of the best things ever. Just combine about 3/4 of a cup of sugar and about two teaspoons or so of cinnamon. In you go. Give it a whisk and it's gonna be ready to roll. Literally, our churros are gonna roll on this. (John laughing) These churros do not have to look perfect. Mine are not. Some people are obsessed with like a perfect star edge and like the perfect shape. And they go ead and they pipe these onto parchment paper and they freeze them and they do this. It's like, that's a whole racket. All we're gonna do is pipe them, cut them, and they're gonna be delicious and amazing. The churros could be really be like whatever size you want, but 3 to 4 inches is a nice tight. These are gonna rest on some paper towels. I have this on a wire rack, but it's really up to you. And your churros we'll cook for about 90 seconds on each side or until golden brown. Fresh churros are the best thing in the world. I've missed these so much because where I live there are no street vendors making fresh churros anymore. My churros are golden brown. We're gonna lift these out and just set them on some paper towels just to drain the excess oil for a minute. A spider is the best tool to have for any deep frying, by the by. After just like 30 seconds or so, your churros have been drained of oil. They still need to be hot and kind of wet. We're just gonna roll these in our cinnamon sugar. So get them nice, nice and covered. You can shake the excess off. These go directly into your mouth. No, I'm kidding. They go directly back onto a wire rack but they can be enjoyed within a minute. There's still a little hot right now. A churro done the right way should be light as air. Light as air, crispy on the outside, and on the inside it just like dissipates into your mouth in a cloud of wonder. It is the best thing ever. I am beyond excited for this and I hope you get to make this recipe. When you're adding the cinnamon sugar, go ead and just spoon some on top so you got really good coverage, cause you want it in all the nooks and crannies. (John laughing) We're filming those right before Easter and Brian has like stocked up on Peeps. How are those Peeps? - [Brian] Good. - He likes them to be stale. I'm not a Peep fan, but in the coents you can let me know if you love Peeps and you like them stale. Why is that a thing? You can always eat the ugly ones before anyone sees them. This one looks a little curved. Towards the end of your churro frying, you can make some easy chocolate dipping sauce. Just combined 2/3 of a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, 2/3 of a cup of cream, and then two teaspoons of cinnamon. Give it a mix and pop it into the microwave for about a minute or so. If it's a little lpy just add a bit more cream, keep stirring, and in an emergency, 10 more seconds in the microwave. Okay. Fried up and golden, ready for a quick dip in some chocolate.

- Hey, I'm John Kanell and
today on "Preppy Kitchen" we're making an easy, delicious frittata so let's get started. Preheat oven to 400 Fahrenheit. We want it nice and toasty by the time our frittata
is coming together. First off, I'm cracking
eight room temperature eggs into a large bowl. This is one of my favorite
ways to do two things. Use up veggies in the fridge
and feed a bunch of people in the morning or later
morning for brunch. No one wants to stand over a
pan and make egg after egg. A frittata is one of the best
way to feed a group of people. And I have to say, I don't think they're as
popular as they should be. One reason is people might
think they're a bit complicated. They're not. You might think, oh, burnt eggs. That's what I thought. I hate burnt eggs. But a properly made
frittata will not be burnt. It'll have a silky, custardy texture with all that cheese, and it's amazing. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. (laughs) You lose track. I'm adding 1/3 of a cup
of heavy cream to this. This is gonna give us a lot of richness and hold everything together. Grab that whisk. And here's the important thing. You're not gonna go crazy on this. Don't do that, please. We're gonna gently mix this together just because if you work
too much air into the eggs, you'll have a lot of little bubbles. And as you might know from baking, those bubbles expand in the oven and it'll be spongy and dry and not silky. So just give it a nice little whisk just to move it together. Not going. (mimics
blender whirring) Mm-mm. This is great. I'm also seasoning this with
about half a teaspoon of salt. This gets set aside. I
have a 12-inch skillet. This is where the magic happens. It needs to be something that
you can pop into the oven so no plastic handles, has to be oven safe otherwise bad things will happen. (smoke alarm beeping)
(fire truck siren blaring) I have a little bit of prep work to do so I'm gonna be chopping an onion. Just give it a rough chop. It doesn't have to be perfect at all, although a finer chop might be nice. I'm not gonna have you
hanging around chopping and waiting for stuff to get warm though. We're gonna stage this out so it all comes together with no waiting 'cause chances are, if
you're making a frittata you have family that's hungry, guests that are coming over and you don't wanna hover and waste time. (knife tapping cutting board)
Okay. Go ahead, heat your oil up
before you chop that onion. Three tablespoons of
olive oil right in there. Once your oil is shimmering
in the pan like it is now we can add that onion in which of course you
chopped while it heated up. And we're gonna stir this occasionally. I want these onions to get translucent and even take on some color. I love caramelized onions so we could take them in
that direction if you want. While our onion is cooking and
you're stirring occasionally, you're gonna mince up
four cloves of garlic. Give this garlic a smash. Very satisfying. Keep stirring occasionally. Say goodbye to that papery skin and hello to sticky garlic
fingers, but it's worth it. And I'm using like four
or five cloves of garlic. I just really go by the mass
of the garlic and how I feel. So however much you want,
it's really gonna work out. Since I have a minute or two left, I'm gonna add some veggies that I like that are in the fridge today. So I have have some zucchini. And we want about three cups of veggies so it's really up to
you whatever they are. You could add some squash into this. There could be potato or sweet potato. I would just say to go on
a slightly thinner side for chopping, just so
things cook up evenly and you have nicer bite-sized pieces. In fact I'm gonna make good choices and quarter this so they're smaller. Stir maybe a little bit more frequently if you see any browning occurring. One bell pepper. I love some bell pepper,
but if you don't like it, something else, like, anything will work. Hmm, this is really getting very hot. A lot of color. Ah. All right, the last
thing I'm gonna add today is a little bit of asparagus. I'm just gonna chop it up
into bite-sized pieces. I'm not gonna add too
much of the woody stocks. I actually like to shave
these down and cook them, use 'em for other things. Gonna add my garlic in. Mm, so fragrant right away. Now I'm adding my chopped
veggies. There we go. The asparagus, the peppers and our zucchini and stir it up. And also a lot of this
moisture is gonna cook off. Too much water in here right now. And depending on your veggies, this'll be about five to eight minutes so just stir, stir, stir. And I'm over medium heat
still so it's not super hot. And it's just gonna cook these guys until they're crisp, tender so you still have a play of textures and it's not just like
a mushy, silky frittata. These guys are almost
where they need to be. They're almost crisp, tender so I'm gonna add some spinach right now, just like a handful or two. You can see the leafy
greens wilt really quickly. And yeah, you could
have used kale in here. Swiss chard is one of my mom's favorites that I love as well so
whenever she comes over when we make something like this, she would definitely bring some
Swiss chard from her garden. So this is where the magic happens. I told you earlier that I do
not like burnt eggs, nope. But these are gonna go into the oven. Our eggs aren't gonna burn because we're gonna cook them properly and they're gonna be
over a bed of veggies. The veggies are gonna get the
blast of heat from the pan. Veggies and some cheese. Right now I'm spreading over
about a cup of shredded cheese. Any cheese you like will work well. Goat cheese, delicious, Gouda, amazing, some mozzarella, cheddar,
Jack, anything you want. I have my egg mixture right here. I'm just gonna pour that
right over everything else. (chimes ringing) Get all that egg out. I'm gonna sprinkle the remaining half cup of cheese over the top. We're gonna cook this
for about five minutes over that medium heat, just
until the edge starts to set. We're not gonna cook
it through in the pan. That would lead to burning. If you look closely, you can see the edge is
just setting on my frittata so this is gonna go into the oven, 400 degrees for about eight minutes or until it's puffed
and set but not burnt. I'm just sprinkling some more
cheese. It'll melt right on. I'm adding some more mozzarella
as well as some Parmesan so grate that on. To finish it off, I'm just
gonna add a few fresh herbs sprinkled over the top. It's very pretty, and
you'll get a kiss of flavor and a little hint of some
herbal wonderfulness. And just like that, your
frittata is ready to enjoy. Those eggs are so silky with
the cheese and the cream. And I love the tenderness of the veggies sprinkled throughout. You've gotta try this recipe. It is the ultimate
breakfast and brunch treat. And if you like this video,

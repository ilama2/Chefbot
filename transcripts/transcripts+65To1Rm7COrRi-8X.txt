 I'm Lush Styling, I'm a professional chef, and today I'm going to show you how to make bakery quality cookies at home. Today we're baking decadent, crispy on the edges, soft and gooey in the center, chocolate chip cookies. This is Chocolate Chip Cookies 101. This cookie has a slightly crispy edge where it's almost a little caramelized in texture, and the middle stays nice and soft. These cookies actually come together as a dough much faster than a normal cookie, but it does have to be refrigerated or frozen for about an hour before baking, and it makes a huge difference. It lets the dough hydrate, it just lets all the flavors marry and meld, so it yields a really good bakery cookie. I'm going to start by mixing together the dry ingredients. I'm using bread flour here, 385 grams of it. I prefer bread flour for these cookies because it guarantees a softer, chewier center. So I'm using a scale just because weighing is the most accurate method of getting this consistent cookie every time you bake. There's a lot less room for error, and you get a bakery-style cookie that's reliable. So I have baking powder and baking soda here, and they're both three grams. So we use both leavening agents in here because they both do different things. Both are leaveners, but the baking powder also helps tenderize the cookies so that you get that nice crumb. You want them to be evenly distributed. So I'm going to use a little bit of flour here, and then I'm going to add the baking powder. So I'm going to add a little bit of flour and then I'm going to add a little bit of baking soda, and then I'm going to add a little bit of baking soda. And then I'm going to add a little bit of baking soda. The baking powder is a little bit of a step but it's a lot easier to get it distributed throughout the dry ingredients because, god forbid, there's a pocket of baking powder or baking soda in a cookie. And then the four grams of kosher salt go in, and that's your dry ingredients. I'm starting with 226 grams of butter. I actually start with all of my ingredients cold. When you start with cold butter, you get layers of pockets of steam, like pie dough or croissant dough, right? So you get this layered effect. I'm just going to smear it around. I'm not trying to cream it. to cream it like really quick so i'm just smearing the butter here and right there you can see loosened up a little bit but it's not actually whipped you're not getting air into it that was like 15 seconds and that's all that it takes on to sugars we have 200 grams of light brown sugar here light brown adds sweetness but also softness in the cookie all relating back to that tender center and 145 for granulated sugar it's a nice balance of flavors the brown sugar making them a little bit softer you also add that undertone of molasses so they both have their roles just adding sweetness or adding more character and tenderizing and making it delicious you're just going to smear it together you don't actually want to cream it right about there i don't want to over mix it because i want to keep that butter cold so the texture right now you can see it's almost like the butter is going to be a little bit more creamy and then you can see the sugar is going to be a little bit more creamy and then you can see the sugar is going to be a little bit more creamy and then butter is just coated in the sugar that's what we're looking for so we have eggs gonna crack into a bowl so that we make sure that there's no shell two eggs 10 grams of pure vanilla extract at this point it's actually gonna look kind of separated and broken but just trust the process you can see there's still a little bit of butter in there it's kind of broken a little bit looks a little separated if you will that's okay it's gonna come together now all of the dry ingredients are in at once so just very slow bring it together you're gonna just feed it until it just comes together there should still be a few streaks of flour in it if you over develop the gluten you'll get a tough cookie nobody wants a tough cookie there's still a little bit of flour visible but that's okay because we are now going to add our chocolate we have two kinds of chocolate 145 grams of bittersweet chocolate and 140 grams of semi-sweet chocolate you can use milk chocolate you can use white chocolate whatever kind you want i love the hand chop i think that it gives you pockets of oozy melted chocolate gives you little shards of chocolate and specks of chocolate throughout the cookie you could absolutely use chocolate chips in this my suggestion would be to hand chop the chocolate chips in there and chop about half of the chips so that you get some of those little shards this is what it looks like when it actually all comes together it's now cohesive but there are still little specks of butter and all of that chocolate is distributed in so the key here is again not to over mix the dough because you want those little specks of butter in there you don't want it creamed and distributed throughout where it's going to be a little melty this looks perfect so we're ready to weigh our cookies we're going to go for about 120 grams per cookie so these are big cookies this is similar to levin style not quite as biscuity i am using a half cup measure here because it's about the size of what the cookie will be you can do it by hand i just prefer not to use a scoop a scoop makes it almost too perfect right you're gonna have the perfect round cookie i like perfectly imperfect so here are our 120 gram cookies all weighed out popping out so i'm going to put them in the freezer for about an hour because i want the dough to rest and absorb and let all the flavors marry but also so they don't bake too quickly when you put them in the oven the outside will be a slightly frozen so they'll keep a little bit of their texture and their height exactly what we want these cookies are fresh out of the freezer nice and cold and firm now they're going in the oven 375 for about 19 minutes you want to rotate them halfway through and i on them might go a little bit longer or a little bit less but 19 tends to be the sweet spot let's go warm cookies i like to give them a little smack just because it settles them and kind of encourages those little craggly bits these were in for about 19 minutes i rotated them halfway through so you've got to take a look at this right all of the craggly bits these edges they're not it's still around cookie don't get me wrong but it has all these little crispy bits and the characters of the peaks and valleys on the top we're going to try to let these rest for 10 minutes on the tray and then move them to a wire rack these cookies in particular i tend to remove when the center still looks slightly under baked you can tell just by pressing on it it should be pretty much set around the edges but still a little soft in the middle and that's exactly where these are if the center is completely loose where it's liquid molten that's a little too underdone but a little slightly under is good in this case you can really tell just by looking at it if it's underdone you'll see a difference in the finish of the cookie it will be more glossy in the very underdone part versus matte where it's baked i'm moving them over to a wire rack to cool completely because at this point they've now carried over as much as i want them to on the warm tray and now i want them to just completely cool without any residual heat i think it's time to taste let's see what we have here chocolatey goodness look at that should take a bite i think so soft in the middle crunchy on the outside look at that chocolate look at those pockets don't you just want to eat the whole tray this cookie is so worth making it at home it's warm chocolate chip cookies whenever you want you can freeze them individually bake off one or two fresh whenever you want it you're in control for a delicious chocolate chip cookie
